<p>NGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have many infectious etiologies. NGU is confirmed in symptomatic men when staining of urethral secretions indicates inflammation without Gram negative or purple diplococci. All men who have confirmed NGU should be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea even if point-of-care tests are negative for evidence of GC. NAATs for chlamydia and gonorrhea are recommended because of the high sensitivity and specificity; a specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, re-infection, and transmission395. Testing for T. vaginalis should be considered in areas or populations of high prevalence.  </p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Presumptive treatment should be initiated at the time of NGU diagnosis. Azithromycin and doxycycline are highly effective for chlamydial urethritis. NGU associated with M. genitalium currently responds better to azithromycin than doxycycline, although azithromycin efficacy may be declining (See Mycoplasma genitalium). </p>
<p>As a directly observed treatment, single-dose regimens may be associated with higher rates of compliance over other regimens. To maximize compliance with recommended therapies, medications should be dispensed on-site in the clinic, and regardless of the number of doses involved in the regimen, the first should be directly observed.</p>
