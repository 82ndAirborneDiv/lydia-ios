<p>Suppressive therapy reduces the frequency of genital herpes recurrences by 70%â€“80% in patients who have frequent recurrences345-348; many persons receiving such therapy report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. Treatment also is effective in patients with less frequent recurrences. Safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily therapy with acyclovir for as long as 6 years and with valacyclovir or famciclovir for 1 year350,351. Quality of life is improved in many patients with frequent recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment352.</p>
<p>The frequency of genital herpes recurrences diminishes over time in many persons, potentially resulting in psychological adjustment to the disease. Therefore, periodically during suppressive treatment (e.g., once a year), providers should discuss the need to continue therapy. However, neither treatment discontinuation nor laboratory monitoring in a healthy person is necessary.</p>
<p>Treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate of HSV-2 transmission in discordant, heterosexual couples in which the source partner has a history of genital HSV-2 infection349. Such couples should be encouraged to consider suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy to prevent transmission, in addition to consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive antiviral therapy also is likely to reduce transmission when used by persons who have multiple partners (including MSM) and by those who are HSV-2 seropositive without a history of genital herpes.</p>
<p>Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir appear equally effective for episodic treatment of genital herpes 334-338, but famciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of viral shedding344. Ease of administration and cost also are important considerations for prolonged treatment.</p>
<h3>Episodic Therapy for Recurrent Genital Herpes</h3>
<p>Effective episodic treatment of recurrent herpes requires initiation of therapy within 1 day of lesion onset or during the prodrome that precedes some outbreaks. The patient should be provided with a supply of drug or a prescription for the medication with instructions to initiate treatment immediately when symptoms begin.</p>
