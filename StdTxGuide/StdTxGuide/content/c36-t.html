        <div class="container"><h3>Diagnostic Considerations</h3>
<p>Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, epidemiologic information, and the exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or genital or rectal ulcers. Genital lesions, rectal specimens, and lymph node specimens (i.e., lesion swab or bubo aspirate) can be tested for C. trachomatis by culture, direct immunofluorescence, or nucleic acid detection 395. NAATs for C. trachomatis perform well on rectal specimens, but are not FDA-cleared for this purpose.  Many laboratories have performed the CLIA validation studies needed to provide results from rectal specimens for clinical management. MSM presenting with protocolitis should be tested for chlamydia; NAAT performed on rectal specimens is the preferred approach to testing.</p>
<p>Additional molecular procedures (e.g., PCR-based genotyping) can be used to differentiate LGV from non-LGV C. trachomatis in rectal specimens. However, these are not widely available, and results are not available in a timeframe that would influence clinical management. </p>
<p>Chlamydia serology (complement fixation titers &gt;1:64 or microimmunofluorescence titers &gt;1:256) may support the diagnosis of LGV in the appropriate clinical context. Comparative data between types of serologic tests are lacking, and the diagnostic utility of these older serologic methods has not been established. Serologic test interpretation for LGV is not standardized, tests have not been validated for clinical proctitis presentations, and C. trachomatis serovar-specific serologic tests are not widely available.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>At the time of the initial visit (before diagnostic tests for chlamydia are available), persons with a clinical syndrome consistent with LGV, including proctocolitis or genital ulcer disease with lymphadenopathy, should be presumptively treated for LGV. As required by state law, these cases should be reported to the health department.</p>
<p>Treatment cures infection and prevents ongoing tissue damage, although tissue reaction to the infection can result in scarring. Buboes might require aspiration through intact skin or incision and drainage to prevent the formation of inguinal/femoral ulcerations. </p>
<p>Although clinical data are lacking, azithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks is probably effective based on its chlamydial antimicrobial activity.  Fluoroquinolone-based treatments might also be effective, but the optimal duration of treatment has not been evaluated.</p>
