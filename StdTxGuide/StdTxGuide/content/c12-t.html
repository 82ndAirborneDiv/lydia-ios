        <div class="container"><h2>Infant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis</h2>
<p>Chlamydia pneumonia in infants typically occurs at 1-3 months and is a subacute pneumonia. Characteristic signs of chlamydial pneumonia in infants include 1) a repetitive staccato cough with tachypnea and 2) hyperinflation and bilateral diffuse infiltrates on a chest radiograph. In addition, peripheral eosinophilia (≥400 cells/mm3) occurs frequently. Because clinical presentations differ, all infants aged 1–3 months suspected of having pneumonia (especially those whose mothers have a history of chlamydial infection) should be tested for C. trachomatis and treated if infected.</p>
<h3>Diagnostic Considerations</h3>
<p>Specimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from the nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard diagnostic test for chlamydial pneumonia. Nonculture tests (e.g., DFA and NAAT) can be used. DFA is the only nonculture FDA-cleared test for the detection of C. trachomatis from nasopharyngeal specimens, but DFA of nasopharyngeal specimens have a lower sensitivity and specificity than culture. Nucleic acid amplification tests are not FDA-cleared for the detection of chlamydia from nasopharyngeal specimens, and clinical laboratories must verify the procedure according to CLIA regulations 395. Tracheal aspirates and lung biopsy specimens, if collected, should be tested for C. trachomatis.</p>
<p>Because test results for chlamydia often are not available at the time that initial treatment decisions must be made, treatment for C. trachomatis pneumonia must frequently be based on clinical and radiologic findings, age of in the infant (i.e, 1-3 months) and risk of chlamydia in the mother (i.e., age &lt;25, multiple partners, and history of chlamydial infection). The results of tests for chlamydial infection assist in the management of an infant’s illness.</p>
