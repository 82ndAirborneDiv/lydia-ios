<p>Characteristic signs of chlamydial pneumonia in infants include 1) a repetitive staccato cough
with tachypnea and 2) hyperinflation and bilateral diffuse infiltrates on a chest radiograph. In
addition, peripheral eosinophilia (≥400 cells/mm3) occurs frequently. Wheezing is rare, and infants are typically afebrile. Because clinical presentations differ, initial diagnostic tests and treatment should include C. trachomatis for all infants aged 1–3 months who are suspected of having pneumonia (especially those whose mothers have a history of chlamydial infection).</p>
<h3>Diagnostic Considerations</h3>
<p>Specimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from the nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard diagnostic test for chlamydial pneumonia. Nonculture tests (e.g., DFA, NAAT) can be used, although DFA of nasopharyngeal specimens have a lower sensitivity and specificity than culture. DFA is the only nonculture FDA-cleared test for the detection of C. trachomatis from nasopharyngeal specimens; NAATs are not FDA-cleared for the detection of chlamydia from nasopharyngeal specimens, and clinical laboratories must verify the procedure according to CLIA specificiations. Tracheal aspirates and lung biopsy specimens, if collected, should be tested for C. trachomatis.</p>
<p>Because test results for chlamydia often are not available in a timely manner, the decision to provide treatment for C. trachomatis pneumonia must frequently be based on clinical and radiologic findings. The results of tests for chlamydial infection assist in the management of an infant’s illness.</p>
