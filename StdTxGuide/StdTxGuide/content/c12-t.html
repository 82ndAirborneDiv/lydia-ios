 Diagnostic Considerations
</h4>
<p>
 Sensitive and specific methods used to diagnose chlamydial ophthalmia in the neonate include both tissue culture and nonculture tests (e.g., direct fluorescence antibody [DFA] tests, EIA, and NAAT). Most nonculture tests are not FDA-cleared for the detection of chlamydia from conjunctival swabs, and clinical laboratories must verify the procedure according to CLIA regulations. Specimens for culture isolation and nonculture tests should be obtained from the everted eyelid using a dacron-tipped swab or the swab specified by the manufacturer&rsquo;s test kit, and they must contain conjunctival cells, not exudate alone. Specific diagnosis of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infection confirms the need for treatment not only for the neonate, but also for the mother and her sex partner(s). Ocular specimens from infants being evaluated for chlamydial conjunctivitis also should be tested for
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 .

 Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate for treatment of chlamydial infection and is unnecessary when systemic treatment is administered.

 Diagnostic Considerations
</h4>
<p>
 Specimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from the nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard for chlamydial pneumonia. Nonculture tests (e.g., EIA, DFA, and NAAT) can be used, although nonculture tests of nasopharyngeal specimens have a lower sensitivity and specificity than non-culture tests of ocular specimens. DFA is the only FDA-cleared test for the detection of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 from nasopharyngeal specimens. Tracheal aspirates and lung biopsy specimens, if collected, should be tested for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis.
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 Because test results for chlamydia often are not available in a timely manner, the decision to provide treatment for
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 pneumonia must frequently be based on clinical and radiologic findings. The results of tests for chlamydial infection assist in the management of an infant&rsquo;s illness and can help determine the need for treating the mother and her sex partner(s).
