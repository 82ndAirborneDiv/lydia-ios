Infants treated with erythromycin should be followed for signs and symptoms of IHPS.</p>

                <p class="regimen_footer_text">† Data on use of other macrolides (e.g., azithromycin and clarithromycin) for the treatment of neonatal chlamydia infection are limited. The results of one study involving a limited number of patients suggest that a short course of azithromycin, 20 mg/kg/day orally, 1 dose daily for 3 days, might be effective (292).</p>
