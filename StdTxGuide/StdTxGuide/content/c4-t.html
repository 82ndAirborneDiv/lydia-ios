<p>A diagnosis of <em>Candida</em> vaginitis is suggested clinically by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either 1) a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) or Gram stain of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae or 2) a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. <em>Candida</em> vaginitis is associated with a normal vaginal pH (&lt;4.5). Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for <em>Candida</em> should be considered. If <em>Candida</em> cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying <em>Candida</em> by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment, because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor <em>Candida</em> sp. and other yeasts in the vagina. PCR testing for yeast is not FDA-cleared; culture for yeast remains the gold standard for diagnosis. VVC can occur concomitantly with STDs. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Short-course topical formulations (i.e., single dose and regimens of 1–3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. The topically applied azole drugs are more effective than nystatin. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy.</p>
<p>The creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil-based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Refer to condom product labeling for further information. Intravaginal preparations of clotrimazole, miconazole, and tioconazole are available over-the-counter (OTC). Even women who have previously received a diagnosis of VVC by a clinician are not necessarily more likely to be able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an OTC preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms within 2 months after treatment for VVC should be clinically evaluated and tested. Unnecessary or inappropriate use of OTC preparations is common and can lead to a delay in the treatment of other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can in turn result in adverse outcomes.</p>
