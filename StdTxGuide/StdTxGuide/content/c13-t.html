 Diagnostic Considerations
</h2>
<p>
 Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness; hydrocele and palpable swelling of the epididymis usually are present. Although the inflammation&nbsp;and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, they can spread to involve the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Testicular torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases, but it occurs more frequently among adolescents and in men without evidence of inflammation or infection. Emergency testing for torsion might be indicated when the onset of pain is sudden, pain is severe, or the test results available during the initial examination do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary-tract infection. If the diagnosis is questionable, a urologist&nbsp;should be consulted immediately because testicular viability might be compromised. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate radiologic method of diagnosis, but it is not routinely available. Although ultrasound is primarily used for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute scrotum&nbsp;swelling, it will often demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling in men with epididymitis. However, differentiation&nbsp;between testicular torsion and epididymitis must be made on the basis of clinical evaluation, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound. Ultrasound provides minimal utility for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis; a negative ultrasound does not alter physician management of clinical epididymitis. Ultrasound, therefore, should be reserved for patients with scrotal pain who cannot be diagnosed accurately by physical examination, history, and objective laboratory findings.
</p>
<p>
 The evaluation of men for epididymitis should include one of the following:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Gram stain of urethral secretions demonstrating &ge;5 WBC per oil immersion field. Gram stain is the preferred rapid diagnostic test for evaluating urethritis because it is highly sensitive and specific for documenting both urethritis and the presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBC containing intracellular Gram-negative diplococci on urethral Gram stain.
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine or microscopic examination of first-void urine sediment demonstrating &ge;10 WBC per high power field.
</p>
<p>
 Culture, nucleic acid hybridization tests, and NAATs are available for the detection of both
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 .&nbsp;Culture and nucleic acid hybridization tests require urethral swab specimens, whereas amplification tests can be performed on urine or urethral specimens. Because of their higher sensitivity, amplification tests are preferred for the detection of
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 . Depending on the risk, patients whose conditions are associated with acquiring an STD should receive testing for other STDs.

 Treatment
</h2>
<p>
 Empiric therapy is indicated before laboratory test results are available. The goals of treatment of acute epididymitis caused by
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 or
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 are 1) microbiologic cure of infection, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention&nbsp;of transmission to others, and 4) a decrease in potential complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and analgesics are recommended&nbsp;until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Because empiric therapy is often initiated before laboratory tests are available, all patients should receive ceftriaxone plus doxycycline for the initial therapy of epididymitis. Additional therapy can include a fluoroquinolone if acute epididymitis is not found to be caused by gonorrhea by NAAT or if the infection&nbsp;is most likely caused by enteric organisms. For men who are at risk for both sexually transmitted and enteric organisms (e.g., MSM who report insertive anal intercourse), ceftriaxone with a fluoroquinolone are recommended.

<p>
 Although most patients can be treated on an out-patient basis, hospitalization should be considered when severe pain suggests other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, or abscess) or when patients are unable or unlikely to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Because high fever is uncommon and indicates a complicated infection, these patients should be admitted for further evaluation.
