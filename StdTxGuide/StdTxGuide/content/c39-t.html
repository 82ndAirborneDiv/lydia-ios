        <div class="container"><h3>Diagnostic Considerations</h3>
<p>Acute PID is difficult to diagnose because of the wide variation in symptoms and signs associated with this condition. Many women with PID have subtle or nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic. Delay in diagnosis and treatment probably contributes to inflammatory sequelae in the upper reproductive tract. Laparoscopy can be used to obtain a more accurate diagnosis of salpingitis and a more complete bacteriologic diagnosis. However, this diagnostic tool frequently is not readily available, and its use is not easily justifiable when symptoms are mild or vague. Moreover, laparoscopy will not detect endometritis and might not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Consequently, a diagnosis of PID usually is based on imprecise clinical findings <sup id="fnref:735"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:735" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:736"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:736" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Data indicate that a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic PID has a PPV for salpingitis of 65%–90% compared with laparoscopy <sup id="fnref:737"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:737" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:738"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:738" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:739"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:739" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. The PPV of a clinical diagnosis of acute PID depends on the epidemiologic characteristics of the population, with higher PPVs among sexually active young women (particularly adolescents), women attending STD clinics, and those who live in communities with high rates of gonorrhea or chlamydia. Regardless of PPV, no single historical, physical, or laboratory finding is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acute PID. Combinations of diagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity (i.e., detect more women who have PID) or specificity (i.e., exclude more women who do not have PID) do so only at the expense of the other. For example, requiring two or more findings excludes more women who do not have PID and reduces the number of women with PID who are identified.</p>
<p>Many episodes of PID go unrecognized. Although some cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health-care provider fails to recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g., abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility <sup id="fnref:740"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:740" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health-care providers should maintain a low threshold for the diagnosis of PID <sup id="fnref:729"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:729" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. The following recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to help health-care providers recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other common causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, and functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID.</p>
<p>Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated in sexually active young women and other women at risk for STDs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, and if one or more of the following minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination:</p>
<ul>
<li>cervical motion tenderness<br />
or</li>
<li>uterine tenderness <br />
or</li>
<li>adnexal tenderness.</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirement that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment could result in insufficient sensitivity for the diagnosis of PID. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STDs.</p>
<p>More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower-genital–tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical exudates, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a diagnosis of PID:</p>
<ul>
<li>oral temperature &gt;101° F (&gt;38.3° C);</li>
<li>abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical friability;</li>
<li>presence of abundant numbers of WBC on saline microscopy of vaginal fluid;</li>
<li>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate;</li>
<li>elevated C-reactive protein; and</li>
<li>laboratory documentation of cervical infection with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>C. trachomatis</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a microscopic evaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal fluid (i.e., wet prep). If the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, the diagnosis of PID is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered. A wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of concomitant infections (e.g., BV and trichomoniasis).</p>
<p>The most specific criteria for diagnosing PID include:</p>
<ul>
<li>endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis;</li>
<li>transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques showing thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies suggesting pelvic infection (e.g., tubal hyperemia); or</li>
<li>laparoscopic findings consistent with PID.</li>
</ul>
<p>A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in some cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted in women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis, because endometritis is the only sign of PID for some women. </p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>PID treatment regimens must provide empiric, broad spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Several parenteral and oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up <sup id="fnref:741"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:741" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:742"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:742" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>. However, only a limited number of investigations have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to elimination of infection in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications (e.g., tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens <sup id="fnref:730"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:730" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:735"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:735" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:743"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:743" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>. The optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper-reproductive–tract infection. The need to eradicate anaerobes from women who have PID has not been determined definitively. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper-reproductive tract of women who have PID, and data from in vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g., <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em>) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. BV is present in many women who have PID <sup id="fnref:731"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:731" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:734"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:734" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>. Until treatment regimens that do not cover anaerobic microbes have been demonstrated to prevent long-term sequelae (e.g., infertility and ectopic pregnancy) as successfully as the regimens that are effective against these microbes, the use of regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made, because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of appropriate antibiotics. When selecting a treatment regimen, health-care providers should consider availability, cost, and patient acceptance <sup id="fnref:742"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:742" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>. In women with PID of mild or moderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. The decision of whether hospitalization is necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether the woman meets any of the following suggested criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be excluded;</li>
<li>tubo-ovarian abscess;</li>
<li>pregnancy;</li>
<li>severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or high fever;</li>
<li>unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen; or </li>
<li>no clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>No evidence is available to suggest that adolescents have improved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, and the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar among younger and older women. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria used for older women. </p>
<h4>Parenteral Treatment</h4>
<p>Several randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of parenteral regimens <sup id="fnref:734"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:734" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:741"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:741" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:742"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:742" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>. Clinical experience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of clinical improvement. In women with tubo-ovarian abscesses, at least 24 hours of inpatient observation is recommended.</p>
<p>Because of the pain associated with intravenous infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline provide similar bioavailability. Although use of a single daily dose of gentamicin has not been evaluated for the treatment of PID, it is efficacious in analogous situations.</p>
<p>When using the parenteral cefotetan or cefoxitin regimens, oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily can be used 24–48 hours after clinical improvement to complete the 14 days of therapy for the clindamycin/gentamicin regimen, and oral therapy with clindamycin (450 mg orally four times daily) or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) can be used to complete the 14 days of therapy. However, when tubo-ovarian abscess is present, clindamycin (450 mg orally four times daily) or metronidazole (500 mg twice daily) should be used to complete at least 14 days of therapy with doxycycline to provide more effective anaerobic coverage than doxycycline alone.</p>
<p>Limited data are available to support use of other parenteral second- or third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone). In addition, these cephalosporins are less active than cefotetan or cefoxitin against anaerobic bacteria. </p>
<h5>Alternative Parenteral Regimens</h5>
<p>Ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline has been investigated in at least one clinical trial and has broad-spectrum coverage <sup id="fnref:744"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:744" rel="footnote">14</a></sup>. Ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline is effective against <em>C. trachomatis</em>, <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, and anaerobes in women with tubo-ovarian abscess. Another trial demonstrated high short-term clinical cure rates with azithromycin, either as monotherapy for 1 week (500 mg IV daily for 1 or 2 doses followed by 250 mg orally for 5–6 days) or combined with a 12-day course of metronidazole <sup id="fnref:745"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:745" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>. Limited data are available to support the use of other parenteral regimens.</p>
<h4>Intramuscular/Oral Treatment</h4>
<p>Intramuscular/oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-to-moderately severe acute PID, because the clinical outcomes among women treated with these regimens are similar to those treated with intravenous therapy <sup id="fnref:729"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:729" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. Women who do not respond to IM/oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and should be administered intravenous therapy.</p>
<p>These regimens provide coverage against frequent etiologic agents of PID, but the optimal choice of a cephalosporin is unclear. Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, has better anaerobic coverage than ceftriaxone, and in combination with probenecid and doxycycline has been effective in short-term clinical response in women with PID. Ceftriaxone has better coverage against <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>. The addition of metronidazole will also effectively treat BV, which is frequently associated with PID.</p>
<h5>Alternative IM/Oral Regimens</h5>
<p>Although information regarding other IM and oral regimens is limited, a few have undergone at least one clinical trial and have demonstrated broad-spectrum coverage. Azithromycin has demonstrated short-term clinical effectiveness in one randomized trial when used as monotherapy (500 mg IV daily for 1–2 doses, followed by 250 mg orally daily for 12–14 days) or in combination with metronidazole <sup id="fnref:745"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:745" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>, and in another study, it was effective when used 1 g orally once a week for 2 weeks in combination with ceftriaxone 250 mg IM single dose <sup id="fnref:746"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:746" rel="footnote">16</a></sup>. When considering these alternative regimens, the addition of metronidazole should be considered to provide anaerobic coverage. No data have been published regarding the use of oral cephalosporins for the treatment of PID. As a result of the emergence of quinolone-resistant <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, regimens that include a quinolone agent are no longer routinely recommended for the treatment of PID. If allergy precludes the use of cephalosporin therapy, if the community prevalence and individual risk for gonorrhea are low, and if follow-up is likely, use of fluoroquinolones for 14 days (levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily, ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily, or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily) with metronidazole for 14 days (500 mg orally twice daily) can be considered <sup id="fnref:747"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:747" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:748"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:748" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:749"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:749" rel="footnote">19</a></sup>. Diagnostic tests for gonorrhea must be obtained before instituting therapy, and persons should be managed as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the culture for gonorrhea is positive, treatment should be based on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.</li>
<li>If the isolate is determined to be quinolone-resistant <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> (QRNG) or if antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be assessed (e.g., if only NAAT testing is available), consultation with an infectious-disease specialist is recommended. </li>
