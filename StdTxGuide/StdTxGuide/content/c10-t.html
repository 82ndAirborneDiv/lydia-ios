<h3>Pregnancy</h3>
<p>Doxycycline is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Human data suggest ofloxacin and levofloxacin present a low risk to the fetus during pregnancy, with a potential for toxicity during breastfeeding; however, data from animal studies raise concerns about cartilage damage to neonates.317  Thus, alternative drugs should be used to treat chlamydia in pregnancy. Clinical experience and published studies suggest that azithromycin is safe and effective524-526. Test-of-cure to document chlamydial eradication (preferably by NAAT) 3-4 weeks after completion of therapy with the recommended regimens because severe sequelae can occur in mothers and neonates if the infection persists. In addition, all pregnant women diagnosed with a chlamydial infection should be retested 3 months after treatment. Detection of C. trachomatis infection at repeat screening during the third semester is not uncommon in adolescent and young adult women, including in those without C. trachomatis detected at the time of initial prenatal screening527,528. Women aged &lt;25 years and those at increased risk for chlamydia (e.g., those who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection) should be rescreened during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the infant 108. </p>
<p>Due to concerns about chlamydia persistence following exposure to penicillin-class antibiotics that has been demonstrated in animal and in vitro studies, amoxicillin, , is now considered an alternative therapy for C. trachomatis in pregnant women529,530. The frequent gastrointestinal side effects associated with erythromycin can result in nonadherence with these alternative regimens. The lower dose 14-day erythromycin regimens can be considered if gastrointestinal tolerance is a concern. Erythromycin estolate is contraindicated during pregnancy because of drug-related hepatotoxicity.</p>
