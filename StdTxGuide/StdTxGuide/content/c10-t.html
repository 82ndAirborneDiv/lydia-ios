        <div class="container"><p>Doxycycline is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Human data suggest ofloxacin and levofloxacin present a low risk to the fetus during pregnancy, with a potential for toxicity during breastfeeding.310 However, clinical experience and published studies suggest that azithromycin is safe and effective515-517. Due to concerns about chlamydia persistence following exposure to penicillin-class antibiotics that has been demonstrated in animal and in vitro studies, amoxicillin should be considered an alternative therapy for C trachomatis in pregnant women518,519. Test of cure to document chlamydial eradication (preferably by NAAT) 3-4 weeks after completion of therapy with the regimens listed below is recommended for all pregnant women to ensure therapeutic cure, considering the severe sequelae that might occur in mothers and neonates if the infection persists. Detection of C trachomatis infection at repeat screening during the third semester is not uncommon in adolescent and young adult women, including in those without C trachomatis detected at the time of initial prenatal screening520,521. Women aged &lt;25 years and those at increased risk for chlamydia (e.g., women who have a new of more than one sex partner or who report their partner has a concurrent partner) therefore should be rescreened during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the infant 107. Pregnant women diagnosed with a chlamydial infection during the first trimester should not only receive a test to document chlamydial eradication, but be retested 3 months after treatment.</p>
<p>The frequent gastrointestinal side effects associated with erythromycin can result in nonadherence with the alternative regimens. The lower dose 14-day erythromycin regimens can be considered if gastrointestinal tolerance is a concern. Erythromycin estolate is contraindicated during pregnancy because of drug-related hepatotoxicity.</p>
