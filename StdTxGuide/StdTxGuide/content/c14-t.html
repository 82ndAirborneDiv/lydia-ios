<p>Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begins in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to involve the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases, but it occurs more frequently among adolescents and in men without evidence of inflammation or infection. In men with severe, unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary-tract infection, or men in whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation of testicular torsion is important because testicular viability might be compromised.  </p>
<p>Bilateral symptoms should raise suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method to diagnose epididymitis, but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be primarily used for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotum swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis must be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. While ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal utility for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis, because a negative ultrasound does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men with scrotal pain who cannot be diagnosed accurately by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings or if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected. </p>
<p>All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following point-of-care tests. </p>
<ul>
<li>Gram, methylene blue or gentian violet (MB or GV) stain of urethral secretions demonstrating ≥2 WBC per oil immersion field <sup id="fnref:478"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:478" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.These stains are preferred point-of-care diagnostic tests for evaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and specific for documenting both urethral inflammation and the presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBC containing intracellular Gram-negative or purple diplococci on urethral Gram stain or MB/GV smear, respectively.</li>
<li>Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine.</li>
<li>Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥10 WBC per high power field.</li>
</ul>
<p>All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> by NAAT. Urine is the preferred specimen for NAAT testing in men <sup id="fnref:394"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:394" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Urine cultures for chlamydia and gonococcal epididymitis are insensitive and are not recommended. Urine bacterial culture may have a higher yield in men with sexually transmitted enteric infections and in older men with acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary bacteriuria.   </p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>To prevent complications and transmission of sexually transmitted infections, presumptive therapy is indicated at the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are available. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk of chlamydia and gonorrhea and/or enteric organisms. The goals of treatment of acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic cure of infection, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) a decrease in potential chlamydia/gonorrhea epididymitis complications (e.g., infertility and chronic pain). Although most men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever suggests other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, and necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Because high fever is uncommon and indicates a complicated infection, hospitalization for further evaluation is recommended.</p>
<p>Therapy including levofloxacin or ofloxacin should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms and gonorrhea has been ruled out by gram, MB, or GV stain. This includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary-tract instrumentation procedures. As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Complete resolution of discomfort may not occur until a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.</p>
