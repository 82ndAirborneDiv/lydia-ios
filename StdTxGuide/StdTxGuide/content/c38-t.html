 Pediculosis Pubis
</h2>
<p>
 Persons who have pediculosis pubis (i.e., pubic lice) usually&nbsp;seek medical attention because of pruritus or because they notice lice or nits on their pubic hair. Pediculosis pubis is usually transmitted by sexual contact.

 Reported resistance to pediculicides has been increasing and is widespread (471&ndash;473). Malathion can be used when treatment&nbsp;failure is believed to have resulted from drug resistance. The odor and long duration of application for malathion make it a less attractive alternative than the recommended pediculcides.&nbsp;Ivermectin has been successfully used to treat lice, but it has only been evaluated in studies involving a limited number of participants.
