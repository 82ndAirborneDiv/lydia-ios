        <div class="container"><p>Persons who have pediculosis pubis (i.e., pubic lice) usually seek medical attention because of pruritus or because they notice lice or nits on their pubic hair. Pediculosis pubis is usually transmitted by sexual contact850.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Reported resistance to pediculcides (permethrin and pyrethrins) has been increasing and is widespread851,852. Malathion can be used when treatment failure is believed to have occurred as a result of resistance. The odor and long duration of application associated with malathion therapy make it a less attractive alternative compared with the recommended pediculcides. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity 853. Ivermectin may not prevent recurrences from eggs at the time of treatment, and therefore treatment should be repeated in 14 days 774,854,855. Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, in turn increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. Adjustment of ivermectin dosage is not required for persons with renal impairment, but the safety of multiple doses in persons with severe liver disease is not known.</p>
<p>Lindane is recommended as an alternative therapy because it can cause toxicity, as indicated by seizure and aplastic anemia856; it should only be used when other therapies cannot be tolerated or have failed. Lindane toxicity has not been reported when treatment was limited to the recommended 4-minute period. Lindane should not be used immediately after a bath or shower, and it should not be used by persons who have extensive dermatitis, women who are breastfeeding, or children aged &lt;10 years856. </p>
