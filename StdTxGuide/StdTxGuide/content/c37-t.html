        <div class="container"><p>Persons who have pediculosis pubis (i.e., pubic lice) usually seek medical attention because of pruritus or because they notice lice or nits on their pubic hair. Pediculosis pubis is usually transmitted by sexual contact826.</p>
<p>Reported resistance to pediculcides has been increasing and is widespread827,828. Malathion may be used when treatment failure is believed to have occurred because of resistance. The odor and long duration of application for malathion make it a less attractive alternative than the recommended pediculcides. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity 829. Ivermectin may not prevent recurrences from eggs at the time of treatment and therefore treatment should be repeated in 14 days 774,830,831. Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased and thus the penetration of the drug into the epidermis increases. Adjustment of ivermectin is not required in persons with renal impairment but the safety of multiple doses in persons with severe liver disease is not known.</p>
<p>Lindane is recommended as an alternative therapy because of toxicity832. It should only be used if there is an inability to tolerate other therapies or if other therapies have failed. Lindane toxicity, as indicated by seizure and aplastic anemia, has not been reported when treatment was limited to the recommended 4-minute period. Lindane should not be used immediately after a bath or shower, and it should not be used by persons who have extensive dermatitis, women who are pregnant or lactating or children aged &lt;2 years.</p>
