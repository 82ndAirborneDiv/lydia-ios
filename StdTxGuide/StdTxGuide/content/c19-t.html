 Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI)
</h3>
<p>
 DGI frequently results in petechial or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetrical arthralgia, tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis. The infection is complicated occasionally by perihepatitis and rarely by endocarditis or meningitis. Some strains of
 <i>
  N. gonorrhoeae
 </i>
 that cause DGI can cause minimal genital inflammation. No recent studies have been published on the treatment of DGI.

 Treatment
</h4>
<p>
 Hospitalization is recommended for initial therapy, especially for patients who might not comply with treatment, for those in whom diagnosis is uncertain, and for those who have purulent synovial effusions or other complications. Examination for clinical evidence of endocarditis and meningitis should be performed. Persons treated for DGI should be treated presumptively for concurrent
 <i>
  C. trachomatis
 </i>
 infection.

 All of the preceding regimens should be continued for 24&ndash;48 hours after improvement begins, at which time therapy can be switched to cefixime 400 mg orally twice daily to complete at least 1 week of antimicrobial therapy. No treatment failures have been reported with the recommended regimens.
