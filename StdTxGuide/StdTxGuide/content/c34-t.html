<p>HIV infection can be diagnosed by serologic tests that detect antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 and by virologic tests that detect HIV antigens or ribonucleic acid (RNA). Testing begins with a sensitive screening test, usually an antigen/antibody combination or antibody immunoassay (IA). Available serologic tests are both highly sensitive and specific and can detect all known subtypes of HIV-1. Most can also detect HIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1 (e.g., group O and group N). Rapid HIV tests enable clinicians to make a preliminary diagnosis of HIV infection within 30 minutes. However, most rapid antibody assays become reactive later than conventional laboratory-based antibody or combination antigen/antibody serologic assays, and thus can produce negative results in recently infected persons. </p>
<p>The recommended diagnostic algorithm for HIV infection consists of a laboratory-based immunoassay, which if repeatedly reactive is followed by a supplemental test (e.g., an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, Western blot, or indirect immunofluorescence assay). However, available HIV laboratory antigen/antibody immunoassays detect HIV infection earlier than these supplemental tests. Therefore, during very early stages of HIV infection, discordant HIV test results (reactive immunoassay results with negative supplemental test results) have been erroneously interpreted as negative <sup id="fnref:303"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:303" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This problem is minimized by use of a combination HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen-antibody (Ag/Ab) immunoassay, which if reactive is followed by an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay <sup id="fnref:304"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:304" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This algorithm confers an additional advantage, as it can detect HIV-2 antibodies after the initial immunoassay. Although HIV-2 is uncommon in the United States, accurate identification is important because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from that for HIV-1 <sup id="fnref:305"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:305" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. RNA testing is performed on all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative supplemental antibody test results to determine whether the discordance represents acute HIV infection.</p>
<p>The following are specific recommendations that apply to testing for HIV infection.</p>
<ul>
<li>HIV screening is recommended for all persons who seek evaluation or treatment for STDs. This testing should be performed at the time of STD diagnosis (e.g., early syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) in populations at high risk for HIV infection.</li>
<li>HIV testing must be voluntary and free from coercion. Patients must not be tested without their knowledge.</li>
<li>Opt-out HIV screening (notifying the patient that an HIV test will be performed, unless the patient declines) is recommended in all health-care settings.</li>
<li>Specific signed consent for HIV testing should not be required. General informed consent for medical care is considered sufficient to encompass informed consent for HIV testing.</li>
<li>Use of Ag/Ab combination tests is encouraged unless persons are unlikely to receive their HIV test results.</li>
<li>Preliminary positive screening tests for HIV infection must be followed by additional testing to definitively establish the diagnosis.</li>
<li>Providers should be alert to the possibility of acute HIV infection and perform an antigen/antibody immunoassay or HIV RNA in conjunction with an antibody test. Persons suspected of recently acquired HIV infection should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical-care provider.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Acute HIV Infection</h3>
<p>Health-care providers should be knowledgeable about the symptoms and signs of acute retroviral syndrome, which develops in 50%–90% of persons within the first few weeks after they become infected with HIV <sup id="fnref:298"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:298" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Acute retroviral syndrome is characterized by nonspecific symptoms, including fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. Suspicion of acute retroviral syndrome should prompt urgent assessment with an antigen/antibody immunoassay or HIV RNA in conjunction with an antibody test. If the immunoassay is negative or indeterminate, then testing for HIV RNA should follow. Clinicians should not assume that a laboratory report of a negative HIV antibody test result indicates that the necessary RNA screening for acute HIV infection has been conducted. Further, HIV home-testing kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore will not detect acute HIV infection.</p>
<p>Persons with acute HIV infection are highly infectious because the concentration of virus in plasma and genital secretions is extremely elevated during this stage of infection <sup id="fnref:294"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:294" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:306"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:306" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. Antiretroviral therapy during acute HIV infection is recommended, because it substantially reduces infectiousness to others, improves laboratory markers of disease, may decrease severity of acute disease, lowers viral set-point, reduces the size of the viral reservoir, decreases rate of viral mutation by suppressing replication, and preserves immune function <sup id="fnref:70"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:70" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. Persons who receive an acute HIV infection diagnosis should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical-care provider, provided prevention counseling (e.g., advised to reduce number of partners and to use condoms correctly and consistently), and screened for STDs. Information should be provided on the availability of postexposure prophylaxis for sexual and needle-sharing partners not known to have HIV infection if the most recent contact was within the 72 hours preceding HIV diagnosis <a href="www.cdc.gov/hiv">www.cdc.gov/hiv</a>.</p>
