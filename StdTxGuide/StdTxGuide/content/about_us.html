<p>The STD Treatment (Tx) Guidelines mobile app serves as a quick reference guide for doctors and related parties on the identification of and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
</p>
<p>The app is a collaboration between CDC's Division of STD Prevention and the Informatics Innovation Unit (IIU) within CDC's Division of Public Health Information Dissemination (DPHID) - Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services (CSELS).
</p>
<p>These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were updated by CDC after consultation with a group of professionals knowledgeable in the field of STDs who met in Atlanta on April 30–May 2, 2013. The information in this report updates the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2010;59 [No. RR–12]). These updated guidelines discuss 1) alternative treatment regimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 2) the use of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis; 3) alternative treatment options for genital warts; 4) the role of Mycoplasma genitalium in urethritis/cervicitis and treatment-related implications; 5) updated HPV vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) the management of persons who are transgender; 7) annual testing for hepatitis C in persons with HIV infection; 8) updated recommendations for diagnostic evaluation of urethritis; and 9) retesting to detect repeat infection. Physicians and other health-care providers can use these guidelines to assist in the prevention and treatment of STDs.
