<p>Newborn infants exposed to HSV during birth, as documented by maternal virologic testing of maternal lesions at delivery or presumed by observation of maternal lesions, should be followed carefully in consultation with a pediatric infectious-disease specialist. Guidance is available on management of neonates who are delivered vaginally in the presence of maternal genital HSV lesions <sup id="fnref:382"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:382" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Surveillance cultures or PCR of mucosal surfaces of the neonate to detect HSV infection might be considered before the development of clinical signs of neonatal herpes to guide initiation of treatment. In addition, administration of acyclovir might be considered for neonates born to women who acquired HSV near term because the risk for neonatal herpes is high for these infants. All infants who have neonatal herpes should be promptly evaluated and treated with systemic acyclovir. The recommended regimen for infants treated for known or suspected neonatal herpes is acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 14 days if disease is limited to the skin and mucous membranes, or for 21 days for disseminated disease and that involving the central nervous system.</p>
