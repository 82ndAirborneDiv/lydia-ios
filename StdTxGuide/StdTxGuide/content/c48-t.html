<p>CNS involvement can occur during any stage of syphilis, and CSF laboratory abnormalities are common in persons with early syphilis, even in the absence of clinical neurologic findings. No evidence exists to support variation from recommended treatment for syphilis at any stage for persons without clinical neurologic findings, with the exception of tertiary syphilis. If clinical evidence of neurologic involvement is observed (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, ophthalmic or auditory symptoms, cranial nerve palsies, and symptoms or signs of meningitis or stroke), a CSF examination should be performed.</p>
<p>Syphilitic uveitis or other ocular manifestations (e.g., neuroretinitis and optic neuritis) can be associated with neurosyphilis. A CSF examination should be performed in all instances of ocular syphilis, even in the absence of clinical neurologic findings. Ocular syphilis should be managed in collaboration with an ophthalmologist and according to the treatment and other recommendations for neurosyphilis, even if a CSF examination is normal. In instances of ocular syphilis and abnormal CSF test results, follow-up CSF examinations should be performed to assess treatment response.</p>
<p>The durations of the recommended and alternative regimens for neurosyphilis are shorter than the duration of the regimen used for latent syphilis. Therefore, benzathine penicillin, 2.4 million units IM once per week for up to 3 weeks, can be considered after completion of these neurosyphilis treatment regimens to provide a comparable total duration of therapy.</p>
