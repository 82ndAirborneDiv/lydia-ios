 Treatment
</h5>
<p>
 Each individual episode of RVVC caused by
 <i>
  C. albicans
 </i>
 responds well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, some specialists recommend a longer duration of initial therapy (e.g., 7&ndash;14 days of topical therapy or a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses [day 1, 4, and 7]) to attempt mycologic remission before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.
</p>
<h5 class="sgc-1" id="sigil_toc_id_290">
 Maintenance Regimens
</h5>
<p>
 Oral fluconazole (i.e., 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months is the first line of treatment. If this regimen&nbsp;is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently as a maintenance regimen can be considered.
</p>
<p>
 Suppressive maintenance antifungal therapies are effective in reducing RVVC. However, 30%&ndash;50% of women will have recurrent disease after maintenance therapy is discontinued. Routine treatment of sex partners is controversial.
 <i>
  C. albicans
 </i>
 azole resistance is rare in vaginal isolates, and susceptibility testing is usually not warranted for individual treatment guidance.

 Severe VVC
</h4>
<p>
 Severe vulvovaginitis (i.e., extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower clinical response rates in patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7&ndash;14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential doses (second dose 72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.
</p>
<h4 class="sgc-1" id="sigil_toc_id_292">
 Nonalbicans VVC
</h4>
<p>
 The optimal treatment of nonalbicans VVC remains unknown. Options include longer duration of therapy (7&ndash;14&nbsp;days) with a nonfluconazole azole drug (oral or topical) as first-line therapy. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule is recommended, administered vaginally once daily for 2 weeks. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70% (380). If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.
